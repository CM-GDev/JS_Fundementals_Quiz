# JS_Fundementals_Quiz

## Description

- This is my second JavaScript homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
- The homework assignment goal was to generate a one page timed quiz game with multiple questions. At the end of the game. the user can save his/her score. 
- In completing this assignment I was able to apply the lessons from week four: Use of DOM API nodes to append, remove, and modify elements. 
- In order to fullfil the requirements of the assigment, I also considerably relied on even listners such as "click" on buttons and text.

The following is a descktop screenshot of the final version of the webpage when it was first submitted for review:
